# Humble Shell
A simple and intuitive shell written entirely in C.

To compile and run, you need to first bootstrap the build executable with `cc -o cbs cbs.c`. Once that's done, you can run `./cbs build` and the shell will build. To build *and* run, type `./cbs run`. To just run the shell after it's been build, run `./bin/hush`.
